# LoopingLouieAI
An AI for the game 'Looping Louie'.
Two Time-of-Flight sensors and a servo motor were added to the game. The sensors detect the plane
flying by, the motor then activates the lever to push the plane up. An Arduino board is the
central control system. The AI was trained by the supervised learning method using linear regression.
